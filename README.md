# Blog-Website

The Blog website is a web application that I developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) as part of my web development projects. The website allows users to create, read, update, and delete blogs, providing a seamless and interactive blogging experience. The frontend is a modern and visually appealing user interface that allows users to view blogs, add new blogs, edit existing blogs, and delete blogs. The frontend communicates with the backend through API calls to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the blogs. The backend of the website is built using Express and Node.js, which handle the logic and functionality for managing blogs. I implemented RESTful APIs to handle various CRUD operations, such as creating new blogs, retrieving blogs from the database, updating blogs, and deleting blogs. I also integrated MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and manage the blogs data, including blog titles, authors, content, etc.
